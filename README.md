Stock Market Prediction Using LSTM
Overview
Stock market prediction is a challenging task due to the complexity and volatility of stock prices. In this project, we use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to predict stock prices based on historical data.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:

Historical stock data is cleaned and sorted by date.
Additional features such as price range, moving averages, and log-transformed volume are created to improve model accuracy.
Data normalization using MinMaxScaler ensures effective training.
Model Architecture:

LSTM layers are combined with Dense, Dropout, and Bidirectional LSTM layers to capture sequential dependencies in stock prices.
The Adam optimizer is used for efficient learning.
Training & Testing:

Data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
The model is trained to minimize prediction errors and prevent overfitting using early stopping and model checkpointing.
Prediction & Evaluation:

The model predicts future stock prices based on past trends.
Performance is measured using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Percentage Error.
Visualizations show actual vs. predicted prices for better interpretability.
Results
The model successfully captures stock price trends with an acceptable margin of error (~2.02%).
A next-day stock price prediction is made, showing the expected stock movement.
Conclusion
LSTM-based models are powerful for time-series forecasting, especially for stock price prediction. However, further improvements can be made by incorporating sentiment analysis, macroeconomic indicators, and ensemble models to enhance prediction accuracy.
